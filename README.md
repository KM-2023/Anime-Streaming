# Anime-Streaming
After a tedious week of combined effort between our team members, we have brought to you a fully functional and ready-to-deploy anime streaming website, where shows and their respective episodes can be easily added in a very easy manner with the help of a graphical user interface. Our project involves the functionalities of a real enterprise-level corporation’s streaming service. This is due to it involving numerous features like the ability to follow shows, like them, and even comment on them. We have also added a “Trending Shows” section in the homepage, which displays the most-viewed shows in order. Obviously, to reach the level of an enterprise corporation security must be taken into consideration. We have implemented a secure authentication mechanism where passwords are run through a hashing algorithm before they are stored in the database. Additionally, all input fields are sanitized to prevent cyberattacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.
